## Fluidfox: A Clean Firefox Theme for mac OS
Fluidfox is meant to replace the standard firefox theme with one that has more polish. Uneven spacing has been fixed, harsh 90's-era shadows have been modernized, and native mac OS styling has been added. This theme supports both light and dark mode.

## Surf the web in style.
Using a privacy-first web browser that lets you block ads shouldn't burden you with bad design.

### Stunning Transparency
Use the built-in stunning mac OS transparency with Firefox without editing code yourself.

### Dark Mode Included
Dim the lights with a built in dark mode. Just set Firefox's theme to Dark or Auto.

### Modern Design for the Modern Browser
Easily opt out of Mozilla's harsh shadows from the 90's and uneven spacing.
